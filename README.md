# My-Programs
Here are some example programs I've written. The only ones currently up are the ones I did for Data Mining 1, some homeworks, my final project and a file containg a bunch of functions I wrote for class. Since I'm currently building a model of a gas cylinder in C CUDA and am in Data Mining 2, I hope to have more up on here within a few months.

Note: The final project in Data Mining includes four items: a paper on cross-validation that I quote (cross-validation-kohavi.txt); an RNW file with all of my code inside of it (FinalProject.RNW); the data set I pulled from the UCI Machine Learning Database (abalone.data.txt); and a short pdf (Summary.pdf) presenting my results, what I did and why I did it.
