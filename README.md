# My-Programs
Here are some example programs I've written that I have cleaned up, fixed their hair and ironed their shirts. The only ones currently up are the final project for Data Mining 1 and some helpful functions or files for Linux and GPU users. I have several other projects that I am going to move up here soon that are currently on my computer like a model of a gas cylinder using C-CUDA, a final project based on a Kaggle data set from Data Mining 2 as well as other functions or files that I wrote and want to keep. 


For the best view of my programming experience and abilities currently on Github, go to my Ramsey Theory project page. It's where I have spent most of my time and energy over the past year or so. In that project, I have incorporated idea from various mathematical disciplines like Operations Research and Deep Learning to help solve a Graph Theory problem. I also used Python and Py-CUDA in an attempt to not only make the program readable but also efficient. 


Note: For the Data Mining 1 Final Project, please read the Summary.pdf first. The goal of the project was to use machine learning to prevent the use of a time-consuming and repetative task. The Summary.pdf assumes a base level of understanding with R and a few machine learning algorithms but goes into more detail on how the algorithms were applied correctly and what accuracy we can expect out of them. Everything else in the file is centered around the FinalProject.Rnw and FinalProject.pdf in it. The first combines R and Latex to make the second which is a detailed report of exactly what I did and my results.
