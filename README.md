# My-Programs
Here are some example programs I've written. The only ones currently up are the ones I did for Data Mining. Since I'm currently building a 
of a gas cylinder in C CUDA and am in Data Mining 2, I hope to have more up to date on here.
Note: The final project in Data Mining is a bit rough looking because we had not covered any visualization techinques yet and because, when building it, we told to pretend that we were presenting our code to a group of fellow data miners and would not need to spend too much time polishing it. However, I added a summary pdf document briefly discusses what I did, why I did it and the results in a quicker and more attractive format.
